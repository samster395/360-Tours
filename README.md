# 360-Tours

Make 360 property tours with ease.

As can be seen from the folder structure, you have client folders and inside that property folders, the photos are listed using their filename.

I take the photos with a Insta 360 One X but you could use photos from a smartphone.

Add property info in the info.json file.

Can be embedded in pages like so: [Property listing example](https://samsstills.co.uk/tours/listing.html)

Made using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
